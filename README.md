# Chrome Extension Tutorial
On the HoogleyBoogley Network, we make all sorts of content, anything from gaming videos, to programing tutorials. I haven't done a tutorial in a long time so this is a sneak peak at my next project.

# What does it do?
The extension will display words and will be in the format of a blog. It doesn't do much as it is a very basic one.

# Languages Used
In this project, we use JSON and HTML. Two very basic languages.

# To do
• Make a tutorial
• Link to a database
